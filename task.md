# React Todo app

### Functionality

1. The app is a simple todo app, with the functionality to add, edit and delete todos
2. The user can also mark a todo as done (doing so would move it to the done tab).

### Details on the task

1. The website should be responsive on all screen sizes (view on different screen sizes provided in the attached images)
2. The UI is expected to be similar to the attached images
    - logo used in the mockup: Microsoft Todos
    - colors used in the mockup: #1976d2 & #F0F8FF
3. Use of any library is allowed (but keeping the code minimal is preferred)
4. Brownie points for using a custom backend
5. If creating only a Frontend project:

    - The todos would be stored in the local storage (or IndexDB) to ensure reloading the page does not lose the data

    Else, if adding a Backend:

    - The todos would be stored in a database (via the backend)

### Judging criteria

You will be judged on the code quality, UX, and responsiveness. The code should be written in React & TypeScript (and/or Express)
